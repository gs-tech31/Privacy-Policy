        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [04/11/2024]</p>
        <p>Thank you for choosing to use our Bhagavad Gita app. Your privacy is very important to us. We want you to understand that we do not collect any personal data or sensitive information from our users, regardless of their age. Please read this policy carefully to understand how our app operates and how it affects your data and device.</p>
        
        <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Our app does not collect, store, or share any personal information about you, including name, email address, location, or any other personal details. This applies to all users, regardless of age. Your privacy is respected and safeguarded as we do not require or store any personal data from you.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Age Requirement</h2>
        <p>The Bhagavad Gita app is accessible to users of all ages, including those below 13 years of age, as it is a dharmic (spiritual) application. We believe in making sacred texts available to everyone, irrespective of age.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Use of Device Storage and Cache</h2>
        <p>To enhance the user experience, our app may store some content locally on your device. This caching helps reduce loading times and allows you to view content offline. However, this data is only stored on your device and is not shared or sent to any external servers.</p>
        
        <h2>4. Access to Device Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Speakers:</strong> Our app utilizes the speaker feature of your device to play audio explanations and recitations of verses, if you choose to listen.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> As mentioned, we use your deviceâ€™s storage solely for caching content. This does not include any collection of your personal files or data.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. No Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any user data, there is no data to share or sell to third parties. Our app is entirely standalone and functions independently without any third-party integrations that would collect or access your information.</p>
        
        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in app functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted within the app. We encourage users to review this policy periodically to stay informed.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
